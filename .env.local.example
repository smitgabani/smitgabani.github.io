# Environment Variables for Portfolio
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values

# GitHub API Token (Optional but recommended for higher rate limits)
# Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Required scopes: public_repo, read:user
# Without token: Uses fallback data from user.json
# With token: Fetches live stats at build time
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token_here

# Stack Overflow API Key (Optional, increases rate limit from 300 to 10,000 requests/day)
# Register app at: https://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register
# Without key: Works fine with 300 requests/day limit
# With key: Higher rate limit for frequent builds
STACKOVERFLOW_API_KEY=your_stackoverflow_api_key_here

# Google Analytics ID (Already configured in _app.js)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-PGHBTZGRC6

# Notes:
# - GITHUB_TOKEN is optional but recommended to avoid rate limits
# - STACKOVERFLOW_API_KEY is optional, 300 requests/day is usually sufficient
# - Environment variables are only used at BUILD TIME (during `npm run build`)
# - For static export, stats are fetched once at build time, not at runtime
# - If API calls fail, fallback data from user.json will be used automatically
