            ‚Ä¢ Migrated inventory application from jQuery to React, leveraging
            React's component-based architecture. Replaced manual DOM
            manipulation with React's virtual DOM . Utilized state management in
            React to enhance user interactions and enable seamless data updates,
            resulting in a more responsive and scalable inventory management
            system.

            üöÄ Created a robust React Boilerplate application that served as a
            foundation for rapid development and consistency, which saved an
            estimated 20% of project setup time for future initiatives. The
            Boilerplate also had some tests which could be continued as the
            application scaled up.
            <br /> üìà Configured AWS services, including Cognito, Amazon Elastic
            Compute Cloud (EC2), DynamoDB, and S3. This resulted in a 30%
            improvement in overall system performance and ensured a seamless
            user experience. <br />
            üîç Conducted comprehensive code reviews and implemented best
            practices (which I have used in my consequent work), which resulted
            in a 15% reduction in bugs and enhancing the codebase's
            maintainability. <br />
            üí° Introduced modern frontend libraries and optimized existing code.
            Using Chrome Lighthouse and Performance insights to test performance
            which decreased loading times by 20% and improved user engagement.
            <br />
            üìä Collaborated with team members using git (VCS) and GitHub
            (Collabration platform). Also used GitHub actions for Continous
            Integration (React test) and Continous Development (S3).
