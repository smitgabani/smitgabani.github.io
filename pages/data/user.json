        "Fragments is a cloud-based microservice developed for a fictional Canadian automotive company that needed to connect, digitize, and automate their internal systems. The company identified a critical gap: many sub-systems needed to work with small fragments of text and images that were smaller than traditional documents and used various formats.",
        "The system solves real business problems: IoT devices on manufacturing floors produce reports in plain text, CSV, and JSON formats. Factory workers use mobile apps to write status updates that need to be saved as JSON, Markdown, Text, or HTML. Automated cameras on assembly lines capture images of damaged parts for audit purposes.",

It supports text formats (plain text, Markdown, HTML, JSON) and image formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF) with automatic format conversion capabilities.",
        "A key feature is the ability to convert fragments between different formats on retrieval—for example, Markdown to HTML or JPEG to PNG—without increasing storage costs since only the original version is stored. All data is isolated per user with proper authorization."
